Higher budget per student doesnt correlate with a higher overall passing rate however schools with a higher budget per student also have a larger school size that may explain the discrepancy in overall passing rates. Schools with the highest overall passing rates varied in budget and school size but were all charter schools. 

The five lowest performing schools shared a high number of students, low per student budget and were all district schools.
